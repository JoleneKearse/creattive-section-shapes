# Notes on Section Creative Backgrounds

I've been learning a lot, taking so many classes, and üíØ upping my skills... But my extreme-let's-go-regime has me running on fumes. üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è 

So happy, fun breaktime! 

I open up **YouTube** and what do I see first?  A **Kevin Powell** video offering me feel-good CSS time. üíó

Check out his [Spice up your site | Easy waves, angles & other creative shapes with CSS video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWGgw1K-i8Y) for yourself.

These notes are my hope to remember the steps myself... üòÇ

## The Designs

### The Diagonal ü™É
![Nice diagonal linear gradient background!](img/diagonal.png)

- Use a class of _.diagonal_ on the section to style up.  For funsies, set the linear gradient to enjoy yourself while applying your CSS magic!
- Create the _transformation_ on the *pseudo-element*, either `::before` or `::after` - dealer's choice. üÉè
- Remember to add the oh so necessary pseudo-element property: `content: '';`.
- Slap whichever background colour you choose, so it'll show your active transforms.
- Set up `position`; `absolute` on the selector, we're working on, and `relative` on it's containing block.
- Back to the pseudo-element (_I think this is getting over-used, so henceforth it will be known as the **PE**_), we'll use the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` shortcut of `inset: 0;`.
- Now for the angle: `transform: skewY(-5deg);`.
- Finally, change the `z-index: -1;` to lower it underneath the block's content and then copy over the `.diagonal`'s background code.

The super-cool new thing üíé I learned was `isolation: isolate;`, which you can apply to the element itself, so the *transform* and *z-index* stay within this containing block. It does this by creating an **independent stacking context**.

A *dev-friendly* tip was to use custom properties for the transform angle and background, so you don't need to scroll through all the code to see what's happening!

### Let's Get Spikey! üòñ

Kevin went with the spikey name here, but I managed more of what I'd call **The Fringe**.  Either way this was simply an awesome effect!

![spikes slash fringe effect](img/spikes.png)

- As per usual set up a `.spikes` class with `position: relative;` and a linear gradient, but then set up some basic styles for both a _before_ and _after_ PE.  
- On both PE's set up a 
```CSS
content: '';
position: absolute;
width: 100%;
height: 50px;
background: purple;
```
Usually they'd automatically have a full width, but the absolute positioning changes that.  The height is pretty much guess work.  The purple will show you where we're working.

![Position of the pseudo-elements](img/spikes1.png)

- Now move them all the way to the top and bottom individually with the `top` and `bottom` properties.

- Use [SVG Path Editor](https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/) to create `triangle.svg`.
- Click on the blue plus circle and select **Move to** for our starting point.
![Using SvgPathEditor's Move To option to select starting point](img/svg1.png)
- If necessary, move the blue dot so the coordinates are `M 0 0`.
![Setting the correct coordinates](img/svg2.png)
- Click the blue plus circle under Path, identified as **Append new command** on hover, then choose **Line to**.  
![Adding another line](img/svg3.png)
- Move to the `L 10 0` coordinates.
![Setting Line To coordinates](img/svg4.png)
- Choose **Line to** again and make an equalateral triange, say `L 5 5`.
- To close it off, at the bottom of the **Append new command** menu, choose **Close path**.
- To the top right of the window, choose **Download as SVG**.  
![Location of Download button](img/svg5.png)
- In the popup window, the colour isn't important, but **do ensure it isn't set to Stroke**!
![Export popup](img/svg6.png)
- Add the file to a new folder in your file structure.
- **Back to the CSS...**
- Add a **mask-image** to the combined style rules for both PE's.  As of _Feb 2023_, **Chrome** still needs this to be prefixed.  `-webkit-mask-image: url('img/triangle.svg');`.  It will cut out certain sections of the triangle and masks it along the way, and repeats all the way across.
![Our spikes showing up repeated all across](img/spikes2.png)
- Change the bottom ones with `transform: rotate(.5turn)` on the bottom PE.
![Rotated bottom pseudo-element](img/spikes3.png)
- Remember that we set the background to purple, so everything where the image is is getting 'masked' away.  Next we can manipulate their height and width.
- But let's deal with the **aspect-ratio** first.  SVG's will always preserve this.  In the `triangle.svg` file, add `preserveAspectRatio="none"` in the `svg` tag.  That will allow the svg to be stretched and squished.
![Adding preserve aspect ratio property to the svg file with a value of none](img/svg7.png)
- With this setting our purple image mask will look like this:
![Initial look with the aspect ratio removed](img/spikes4.png)
- **Warning:**  The image mask won't really work with a background linear gradient image on the entire page, ie - on the body.  It's fine on the section, but there could be issues.
- So... To make it a little easier, you can set up a custom property on the root for the page's background colour then use that on the _spike PE's_, like on lines 73 and 87 in the code below.
- Now you can manipulate the spikes with the **mask-size** property, which will take width and height values. So playtime! If the height here is different than the PE's height there could be repeating issues.  But you could use custom properties to simplify control.
![full code on element, pseudo element combined code, then separate values](img/spikes-code.png)

**But be aware:**  Using a `transform` and a `rotate` on the bottom PE could cause issues if the user zooms in on the page.  It's a rendering issue that could cause it to look messy!  _To solve this, you could make a separate svg image for the bottom._

- Also remember to copy and paste all the mask properties without the prefix!

### Getting Wavy üåä

**Note:** This method _could_ be used for the spikes, but your control over the final effect would be lessened.
